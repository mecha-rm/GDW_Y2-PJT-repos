# GDW_Y2-PJT-repos
Repository for our second year game development engine and game.
The game is named 'Codename: ZERO'.

NOTE: the Shader and stb_image files may need to get removed depending on how our C++ projects develop for Computer Graphics.
TODO: expand on this README to add in reference information and related details regarding the project.
