NOTES
*****
- Sounds and music do not trigger consistently. We are unsure of why this is, but the sound may not always work.
	- Notably the engine project (BF PJT) does not have any audio enabled.
- the game will crash if it switches scenes too many times. So it's best that only the map levels are entered.
	- The ranking scene wasn't completed, so there's no point in going in there. But if you do go in there, just click on the game logo to go back.
- the mouse clicks can be a bit finicky. Try looking at the C++ console to see if shaders are being compiled after a mouse click. If so, then the scene is being switched.
